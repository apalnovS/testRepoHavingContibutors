Murder I am, you know it was me
I was the one, that you didn’t see
I was the cut, down to your bone
I put you there under that stone
I, I am the blade, I am the dream of the brave
I, I am the knife, I bring grief to your wife
I, I am the sword, I am the word of the Lord
Do what you will, I bring you the edge
I am the one to sever your head
I cut so deep, I can cut straight
All depends on the moves you make
I, I am the blade, I am the promise unmade
I, I am the knife, I bring death to your life
I, I am the ax, to stop your dead in your tracks
I, I am the sword, I bring the fear of the Lord
Centuries pass, dust int he wind
I shall remain, shining in sin
The metal I am, the iron you feel
The song of the dead, the chorus of steel
I, I am the blade, I break the oath that you made
I, I am the mace, I am the blow in the face
I, I am th ax, to cut down heroes like rats
I, I am the sword, I do the work of the Lord
